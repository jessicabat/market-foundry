"4:50cb0b36-a987-4622-88f1-23fd5ada75f6:13","Person","GPT's predictions are more likely to be inaccurate when the firm is smaller in size, has a higher leverage ratio, records a loss, and exhibits volatile earnings."
"4:50cb0b36-a987-4622-88f1-23fd5ada75f6:14","UNTYPED","GPT's performance comes from its memory, e.g., due to the model's ability to identify the company based on numeric data."
"4:50cb0b36-a987-4622-88f1-23fd5ada75f6:15","Person","GPT's predictive ability"
"4:50cb0b36-a987-4622-88f1-23fd5ada75f6:16","UNTYPED","Another explanation is that the strength of the model is in its ability to generate narrative insights based on its analysis of numeric data."
"4:50cb0b36-a987-4622-88f1-23fd5ada75f6:17","UNTYPED","We explore each of these possibilities next."
"4:50cb0b36-a987-4622-88f1-23fd5ada75f6:18","Question","First, can a large language model generate economic insights purely from the numbers?"
"4:50cb0b36-a987-4622-88f1-23fd5ada75f6:19","Answer","How does an LLM's per-performance compare to that of human analysts and do they add incremental value?"
"4:50cb0b36-a987-4622-88f1-23fd5ada75f6:20","Question","Can the model's performance be enhanced via instructions that emulate steps typically followed by financial analysts?"
"4:50cb0b36-a987-4622-88f1-23fd5ada75f6:21","Answer","How does LLM’s performance compare to other benchmarks, such as logistic regression and a state-of-the-art ANN design, and whether the model can offer additional insights?"
"4:50cb0b36-a987-4622-88f1-23fd5ada75f6:22","Question","Conceptually, an LLM can add value relative to a human analyst due to its ability to quickly analyze large quantities of unstructured data and a vast knowledge base that enables to model to recognize patterns, e.g., familiar business situations, in the data."
"4:50cb0b36-a987-4622-88f1-23fd5ada75f6:23","Answer","It is not obvious, however, that these considerations are particularly relevant for the present task."
