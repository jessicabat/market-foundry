President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. PayPal is a fundamentally stronger
company today than it was two years ago. Focus and execution have enabled us to drive a positive inflection
across our business, take transaction margin dollar growth, excluding interest on customer balances. We are on
pace for 6% to 7% growth in 2025, compared to negative growth just two years ago.
Revenue growth has accelerated in the past two quarters as a result of our deliberate strategy to focus on
profitable growth. Operationally, we are winning new customers and deepening engagement across our existing
base. We have reinvigorated unprofitable and underperforming parts of the business.
We're leveraging our incredible brands to innovate and expand our addressable markets beyond online
payments. Thanks to our omnichannel initiatives, we've accelerated branded experiences TPV growth to be
between 7% and 8% on a currency-neutral basis over the past four quarters.
Our BNPL business is sustaining 20% volume growth quarter after quarter. Venmo revenue growth has
accelerated 10 points, compared to two years ago, while we have also continued to grow our user base.
Our Enterprise Payments business has turned a corner, returning to volume growth and consistently contributing
to company transaction margin dollar growth. We have delivered this acceleration in our business, while remixing
inefficient spend into growth investments and returning capital to shareholders.
And in total, we are on pace to deliver at least 15% non-GAAP EPS growth this year. All of this gives us
confidence in the business' longer-term growth potential, and ability to deliver high single-digit transaction margin
dollar growth and non-GAAP EPS growth in the teens or better over the longer term.
I'm also excited to announce that we are initiating a dividend. Our overall capital allocation priorities remain the
same. We will continue investing, first and foremost, in our business' growth and transformation. We see this
dividend as strengthening our overall capital return program, working in conjunction with our ongoing share
buybacks.
Our free cash flow generation and balance sheet are strong, and give us ample room to both deploy capital to
drive growth and return capital in a disciplined way to shareholders. Put simply, this is the new PayPal, built for
faster, more profitable growth. Our strong foundation, differentiated competitive advantages and clear strategic
direction, position us to capture a massive and growing addressable market.
With building execution momentum, we are driving innovation at a remarkable pace and scale. This makes us
exceptionally well placed to win into the future.
Turning to our third quarter performance. We delivered at or above the high end of our guidance range for
transaction margin dollars and EPS. Importantly, our TM dollar growth continues to come from multiple areas of
the business, including branded experiences, PSP and Venmo.
Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 12%, reflecting the flow-through of our transaction margin performance.
The strength of our two-sided platform is evident in how customers are choosing to deepen their relationship with
us. Monthly active accounts grew 2%.

When you look at transactions per active account growing 5%, excluding PSP, you see the real story. Customers
aren't just signing up, they're incorporating PayPal and Venmo into their daily lives. This engagement depth
makes us a valuable partner to merchants and will drive sustainable, profitable growth.
Now, I'd like to discuss the progress we are making in our four strategic growth drivers: winning checkout; scaling
omni and growing Venmo; driving PSP profitability; and scaling our next-gen growth vectors.
As you can see on slide 4, PayPal's TM dollar growth, excluding interest, has not only accelerated, it is coming
from a far more balanced mix across our business. This is important to appreciate the strategy underpinning the
value our teams are working to create.
Compared to last year, win checkouts contribution increased, and PSP, omni and Venmo's contributions are a
multiple of what they were in the past. This is a direct result of the work we have done to build more holistic,
healthier merchant relationships to scale our omnichannel presence and to monetize Venmo.
The innovation and momentum across the company are increasingly visible, as you have seen in our recent
announcements and as you will hear today. I plan to move quickly so that we can go deep in a few key areas like
BNPL and Venmo, while also leaving ample time for Q&A.
Let me start with branded experiences, which covers our first two growth drivers: online and in-store branded
checkout. Our strategy is to meet our customers everywhere they shop, whether online, in-store or agentic. We
are focused on delivering the best checkout experience so consumers can pay how, where and when they want.
It means they could pay online with PayPal, buy now, pay later, Venmo, crypto, or soon a partner wallet through
PayPal World. It means they can pay in-store with a PayPal or Venmo debit card, BNPL or tap to pay. And it
means building for a future where consumers can pay through AI agents powered by Google, OpenAI, Perplexity
and others.
Last September, we launched PayPal Everywhere in the US to move beyond our legacy in online branded
checkout into an omnichannel world. A year-in and the results show our strategy is working. Branded experiences'
TPV grew 8% on a currency-neutral basis in the quarter. This includes PayPal, buy now, pay later, Venmo and
our debit card programs and is the single most important metric to track the progress on transformation from an
online payments company to a commerce company.
We need to be available everywhere a consumer wants to make a purchase, but this is about more than being
present across channels. It's fundamentally expanding what PayPal means to our customers and the total
spending we can capture. Historically, PayPal was synonymous with online retail payments. Today, we're
evolving the way consumers pay for all of their commerce needs. Moving beyond retail into services,
subscriptions, bills, everyday expenses and more. We are now playing for a much bigger addressable market.
Our confidence in the financial impact of this strategy comes from the flywheel effects we see across our
ecosystem. When customers start using PayPal or Venmo offline with our debit card, their online activity
increases as well, ARPA goes up, profitability improves. In Q3, our PayPal debit card actives transacted nearly 6
times more and generated nearly 3 times the ARPA of checkout-only accounts.
We see a similar pattern with BNPL. Its use drives an uplift in overall activity and engagement. The data clearly
validates our strategy and gives us confidence to increase our growth investments.

Most of our product initiatives, plus our marketing investments over the past year, has started in the US. It's worth
examining our US proof points as they demonstrate the potential for our business as adoption scales
internationally.
For example, in the third quarter, we reached 10% branded experiences volume growth in the US, more than
double our growth in the same quarter a year ago. That acceleration comes from two things: growing
omnichannel adoption and sustained improvement in the US online branded checkout trends, supported by our
improved experiences.
We have the right set of drivers and initiatives in place. Now our focus is on adoption and investing to amplify our
impact. As we move into 2026, we will be leaning more into these efforts and expanding across key international
markets.
Let me address online branded checkout in more detail. TPV grew 5% in the third quarter on a currency-neutral
basis. That solid growth, especially with the choppy global macro trends we continue to see this quarter. Given
the competitive intensity online, we know more work is needed to close the gap between our performance and
overall e-commerce growth.
Our strategy moving into next year centers on three priorities: continuing to scale our redesigned checkout
experiences, improving how we are prioritized across merchants, and importantly, driving biometric adoption. We
are also leaning into new verticals and geographies that expand our addressable market and avenues for growth.
All of this will be complemented by a consumer value prop with a highly competitive rewards program aimed at
increasing frequency and selection rate. We also have a powerful growth lever with buy now, pay later and
Venmo, which I'll discuss further shortly.
This year, we've made significant progress deploying our redesigned paysheet experience, which now covers
close to 25% of our global checkout transactions. We're moving quickly, but untangling a decade or more of
legacy integrations is complex and taking more time than planned.
In the cohorts where we are now optimized in the US, we continue to see close to 1-point conversion
improvement. This gives us confidence it's a win, not if, we see more benefit from this modernization. At the same
time, it's critical that we keep improving PayPal's prioritization across merchants and scaling biometric login, both
of which have been proven to increase conversion.
On the prioritization side, we are focused on scaling upstream messaging on product pages, driving adoption of
our payment-ready API that allows merchants to target high-converting PayPal users when they land on their site
and improving PayPal's placement at checkout.
Improved prioritization and presentment are powerful. In testing, when our buy now, pay later options are
presented upstream on a product page, we see a nearly 10% lift in branded checkout volume on average. That
improvement drives incremental sales for our merchants and customer loyalty with repeat use for PayPal.
Within biometrics, we are focused on scaling biometric login, including passkeys and driving mobile app adoption,
which enables seamless authentication during checkout. In ongoing testing to-date, these authentication efforts
when paired with the redesigned paysheet we've been scaling have showed improved conversion between 2
percentage points to 5 percentage points.

Consumers benefit from a mobile checkout experience that is second to none, while merchants see a higher
customer satisfaction and sales. It's a win for both sides of our network.
The bottom-line, the initial results we have seen to-date in the US make us confident we're on the right path and
have the right initiatives in place, both to drive acceleration and increase growth investments as we move through
next year.
Now that I've covered some of the foundational work underway, let me dive deeper on two important growth
levers that I mentioned, BNPL and Venmo.
The shift towards buy now, pay later is a fundamental change in how consumers want to pay, and we are
extremely well-positioned to capture this shift. In the markets where we offer BNPL, our solutions are available
nearly everywhere PayPal is accepted. It's a reach and scale that's hard to replicate. This quarter, BNPL volume
continued to grow more than 20%, with particular strength in the US. This puts us on track to process close to $40
billion in BNPL TPV in 2025.
Monthly active accounts climbed 21%, and our Net Promoter Score globally is 80. People love this product. We
have everything we need to win this market. We are investing to transform our BNPL business from a payment
option that consumers discover in the PayPal wallet after they made a purchase decision into a customer
acquisition channel. This means moving to the beginning of the shopping journey through marketing and
upstream presentment, so that consumers know they can increase their purchasing power with BNPL. This focus
and investment will expand our right to win in BNPL and further accelerate growth.
We are also expanding BNPL to new geographies and introducing new product offerings, both online and in-store.
We have successfully expanded BNPL into Canada and extended payment terms in Italy and Spain to up to 24
installments.
After proving the model in Germany, we brought BNPL in-store to the US through the PayPal mobile app
seamlessly connecting online and offline shopping. We are building the future of flexible payments, and we're
doing it at scale.
Moving to our Venmo business. Venmo isn't just another payment app. It's the money movement platform of
choice for the next generation. One of the things that continues to set Venmo apart is its user base, young,
affluent, digitally native consumers who are shaping the future of commerce. With nearly 100 million total active
accounts growing mid-single-digits, Venmo has tremendous scale in this attractive demographic.
We have a deliberate sequence strategy that's changing how these users engage with Venmo. At the core is
maintaining our leadership as the best P2P platform in the market, attracting more funds into the Venmo
ecosystem, driving omnichannel spending and seamlessly integrating commerce into the Venmo app. We are
already seeing results.
Venmo is at a clear inflection with TPV growing 14% in the third quarter continuing to accelerate from 12% in Q2
and 9% in 2024. Pay with Venmo just hit a milestone, $1 billion of TPV in September alone and Pay with Venmo
monthly active accounts grew by nearly 25% in the quarter.
We hit a new record with our Venmo debit card, which attracted 1 million first-time users in Q3, thanks in part to
our college partnerships. Monthly Venmo debit actives grew by more than 40%. This has resulted in overall

Venmo monthly active account growth accelerating to 7% year-over-year to nearly 66 million monthly active
accounts.
From a financial perspective, Venmo is on pace to generate $1.7 billion in revenue this year, excluding interest
income. That's up more than 20% and a 10-point acceleration from two years ago.
Under the surface, we are also changing our revenue mix and growing in high-margin areas. Over the past two
years, we've doubled Pay with Venmo and Venmo debit card revenue. Not only can Venmo become a more
significant revenue driver as it scales, but it is also accretive to transaction margin.
And here's what makes this so compelling. We're still in the early innings of monetization. Today, Venmo's
average revenue per monthly active account sits at just over $25. While over 90% of Venmo's users engage with
P2P, only 5% to 10% are using our debit card or Pay with Venmo, and less than 5% have set up recurring funds
in. For the subset of accounts engaged across P2P, debit and Pay with Venmo, which is still small today, ARPA is
about 4x higher.
For accounts that are also bringing funds in through direct deposit or instant add, ARPA is 6x higher. In other
words, the upside on Venmo's revenue is a multiple of where we stand today. The good news is that adoption is
accelerating.
For example, new users today are adopting our debit card at nearly 4 times the rate they were two years ago,
giving us massive runway as we continue driving attachment of these high-value products. This is one of the
reasons why we are investing in our college partnerships and introducing unique, personalized rewards that drive
multi-product adoption and encourage balanced spending within the Venmo ecosystem.
We're also expanding Pay with Venmo into new high-value use cases like our Bilt partnership for rent payments.
At Investor Day, we discussed growing Venmo revenue to more than $2 billion by 2027 and it's clear that the
team's execution will allow us to deliver well beyond this over time. Taken together, these businesses, online
branded checkout, BNPL, Venmo and omni, drove branded experiences TPV growth of 8% on a currency-neutral
basis.
Moving to our PSP business. Our PSP volume growth accelerated to 6% from 2% last quarter, demonstrating that
we are accelerating growth after re-baselining. This growth is profitable and contributed to transaction margin
dollar growth in the quarter. We are doing this by continuing to build holistic relationships with merchants.
Value-added services like payouts, adaptive payment optimization and FX-as-a-Service, deliver real measurable
value, including improvements to authorization rates and cost reduction. We're seeing merchants not only willing
to pay for these capabilities, but actively requesting more of our services as they begin to recognize the benefits
for their business.
As we continue to expand our unified enterprise payments platform globally, we are bringing these marginaccretive services to new merchants from day one. We expect accelerated growth in this business as we expand
the adoption of value-added services across our existing customer base, and launched with Verifone as our first
omnichannel solution provider in Q4, strengthening our position in the PSP market.
While we accelerate growth in branded experiences and PSP, we are also aggressively innovating in agentic,
ads, stablecoins and digital wallet interoperability through PayPal World to establish avenues for future growth. I'll
highlight just a few of our recent developments.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call

28-Oct-2025

We continue to partner with leaders across the agentic space, including Perplexity earlier this year. And in
September, we announced our expansive multiyear partnership with Google to create new AI shopping
experiences. This morning we announced a significant partnership with OpenAI to expand payments and
commerce in ChatGPT, including adding PayPal branded checkout for shoppers and payment processing for
merchants using Instant Checkout. This is a big win for PayPal and our customers.
Today, we also announced our own agentic commerce services, which help merchants sell-through multiple AI
platforms, including Google, OpenAI and Perplexity. Merchants will have one integration to access consumers
through multiple LLMs. Agentic commerce will take time, but we do believe consumer behavior will shift. PayPal is
building for that future.
Finally, I'm very excited to share that PayPal World is officially in its pilot stage, and the first test transactions are
happening this week. I'm proud of the progress that we made this quarter from partnerships to new product
innovations to continuing to strengthen our profitability.
With that, let me turn it over to Jamie to go into the financials in more detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jamie S. Miller
Chief Financial & Operating Officer, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

Thanks, Alex. Moving to slide 10. PayPal delivered another quarter with good execution and real momentum
across the underlying business. TPV and revenue growth both accelerated by 2 points from the second quarter.
Transaction margin dollars excluding interest grew 7%, continuing the momentum we built through the first half.
The drivers of that growth have been broad-based, led by strong credit performance, branded checkout flow
through, improvements in PSP profitability, and Venmo monetization.
Growth across these areas was partially offset by higher transaction losses in the quarter. The diversification and
quality of this growth is a meaningful improvement from where we were at the start of the company's
transformation. We have clear opportunities to build on this progress with investments that strengthen our
competitive position and drive durable profitable growth.
Moving back to third quarter financials. Non-GAAP operating income grew 6%, strong operating income, share
buyback and a favorable tax rate more than offset headwinds from lower interest rates, contributing to 12%
growth in non-GAAP EPS.
Adjusted free cash flow, which excludes the timing impact from the origination and sale of pay later receivables
was $2.3 billion, or $4.3 billion year-to-date.
Turning to slide 11. We are driving deeper, more active relationships with our customers. Monthly active account
trends showed steady progress, up 2% year-over-year to 227 million. Transactions per active account, excluding
PSP, which is a good proxy for engagement, accelerated to 5% growth.
Moving to slide 12. Total payment volume accelerated to 8% growth at spot and 7% on a currency-neutral basis
to over $458 billion. We've moved branded experiences to the top of this slide to reflect the importance of this
metric to our more expansive strategy and value creation.

Looking across the product portfolio, we see encouraging signs that our initiatives are gaining traction and making
an impact. Branded experiences TPV, which includes online checkout, PayPal and Venmo debit as well as tap-topay, posted another quarter of 8% growth. As Alex mentioned, US branded experiences TPV growth accelerated
to 10% in the quarter, benefiting from both omnichannel adoption and better trends in US online branded
checkout.
While debit card and tap-to-pay spend represent a small portion of branded experiences volume today, they are
growing rapidly, up 65% year-over-year, accelerating from last quarter. Venmo TPV growth accelerated 2 points
to 14%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.
On an online-only branded checkout basis, volume grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis. Compared to last
quarter, there was less pressure on volumes from Asia-based marketplaces selling into the US. At the same time,
this improvement was offset by pockets of softer consumer discretionary spending in Europe and the US later in
the quarter.
Overall, we have seen relatively consistent growth in the number of checkout transactions, but basket sizes or
average order value has decreased. While still early in a back-end loaded quarter, we've observed this trend
continuing through October.
We remain focused on the initiatives we can control. We're confident in our branded checkout strategy and the
roadmap that our teams are advancing. The early results in the US demonstrate that we're on the right path with
our initiatives, including our redesigned experiences, buy now, pay later, and Pay with Venmo.
We're laser-focused on execution across the three key areas Alex discussed; scaling our redesigned experiences,
improving prioritization and driving biometric adoption. All of this is increasingly complemented by a compelling
consumer value prop that differentiates PayPal and Venmo as one of the best most rewarding ways to pay.
While this work is complex and takes time, we fully expect to see our efforts build as we move through the next
year and scale these initiatives. Pay with Venmo and buy now, pay later continue to outpace the market, taking
share from other payment methods, growing 40% and 20%, respectively. These results give us the confidence to
begin making targeted investments in the fourth quarter that amplify the impact of these and other initiatives
throughout the portfolio.
Turning to PSP, which spans both enterprise and SMB processing as well as parts of our VAS portfolio like
payouts, invoicing and point of sale solutions, volume growth accelerated to 6% from 2% in the first half of the
year.
Our focus on prioritizing healthy, quality growth within our enterprise payments business is contributing to steady
improvement in both revenue growth and TM dollars. We expect to see ongoing improvement in the quarters
ahead supported by profitable front book business, our existing merchant base and the attachment of valueadded services.
Moving to more financial detail on slide 13. Transaction revenue accelerated to 6% growth on a spot basis to $7.5
billion. Other value-added services revenue grew 15% to $895 million, driven by another quarter of strong
performance in consumer and merchant credit.

We've also been encouraged by growth in customer balances and the impact of our initiatives designed to
encourage customers to bring more funds into the ecosystem. While lower interest rates are still a headwind, a
portion of this impact has been offset by higher balances.
We continue to be pleased with the quality, diversification and performance of our credit portfolio. In September,
we took another step forward in line with our balance sheet light model for credit, externalizing a portion of our
short-term US pay later receivables with Blue Owl Capital.
We ended the quarter with $6.4 billion in net loan receivables, down 8% sequentially. Transaction take rate
declined by 3 basis points to 1.64%, driven largely by product and merchant mix as well as the impact of foreign
exchange hedges. This decline was an improvement relative to last quarter and included less impact from foreign
exchange hedges and enterprise processing.
Online branded checkout take rates continue to be relatively stable year-over-year, reflecting our transaction and
merchant mix as well as our focus on profitable growth. As I mentioned earlier, TM dollars ex interest grew 7%.
TM dollar growth included a 1.5-point headwind from higher volume-based expenses, largely transaction loss
provisions, resulting from the temporary service disruption in August, which primarily impacted Germany. There
was also a slight benefit, less than 1 point, from the Blue Owl pay later externalization I referenced earlier.
Setting aside the impact of loss provisions related to the August service disruption, we've seen an improvement in
transaction loss rates relative to last quarter. Non-transaction-related OpEx increased 6%, as we continue to
actively manage our cost structure while reinvesting in key growth initiatives. Non-GAAP operating income grew
6% in the quarter to nearly $1.6 billion.
Moving to capital allocation. As you saw in our materials and heard from Alex, I'm excited to share that we are
initiating a dividend as part of a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our strong free cash flow generation and
balance sheet give us ample room to both deploy capital for growth and return capital to shareholders. In general,
we continue to target about 70% to 80% of our free cash flow for capital return with the vast majority going to
buyback.
The dividend serves as a complement to our existing buyback plans and will be calculated based on a 10%
payout ratio relative to net income. This quarter we completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases bringing share
repurchases over the past four quarters to $5.7 billion.
Finally, we ended the quarter with $14.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments and $11.4 billion in
debt.
Moving to guidance on slide 14. Following another quarter of strong financial performance, we are raising our full
year guidance for TM dollars and non-GAAP EPS. For the fourth quarter, we expect currency-neutral revenue
growth in the mid-single digits. We expect fourth quarter TM to be between $4.02 billion and $4.12 billion, which
represents about 3.5% growth at the midpoint. Excluding interest on customer balances, we expect TM dollars to
grow by about 5% at the midpoint compared to 7% year-to-date.
Setting interest rates aside, there are a few factors to highlight that impact our fourth quarter outlook. First, we
have seen strong credit outperformance over the past year, driven by good execution from the team as well as a
more benign loss environment. We expect to see year-over-year comparisons start to normalize more in the
fourth quarter.

Second, given the performance of some of our key initiatives, we see an opportunity to lean into our competitive
differentiation with additional investment to drive faster growth over time. In the fourth quarter, we will begin
increasing investments designed to drive product attachment and habituation. Some of these investments are
linked to volumes and, therefore, recorded as contra revenue impacting TM dollars and designed to drive
additional growth over time. Other growth investments such as global brand awareness campaigns, typically sit
within marketing and non-transaction OpEx.
Lastly, on TM, our fourth quarter guide assumes some deceleration in branded checkout growth relative to our
third quarter average. From a volume perspective, the most important weeks and months of the quarter still lay
ahead. That said, we are planning prudently given recent spending trends and the uncertain macro backdrop. We
are also cognizant of lapping strong consumer spending in the fourth quarter of last year.
Moving to OpEx, we are planning for low single-digit non-transaction OpEx in the quarter and expect about 3%
growth for the full year. We expect to deliver fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.27 to
$1.31, up 7% to 10%.
For the full year, we are raising our TM dollar guidance by $100 million at the low end and $50 million at the high
end to a range of $15.45 billion to $15.55 billion, which represents 5% to 6% growth. Excluding interest, we
expect TM dollars to grow between 6% to 7%.
We are raising our full year non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to a range of $5.35 to $5.39, growing at 15%
to 16%. Our guidance continues to project approximately $6 billion in share buyback and full year adjusted free
cash flow of approximately $6 billion to $7 billion, which excludes the timing impact of the origination and sale of
pay later receivables.
I'd like to wrap-up by thanking the PayPal team for their hard work and execution this quarter. We are making
tangible progress across the business and the foundation we're building positions us well for continued growth
ahead.
With that, back to you, Alex.

James Alexander Chriss
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

Thanks, Jamie. We are operating from a position of strength. The results you're seeing are proof that our strategy
is working. We built a more balanced, profitable growth engine across branded experiences, PSP and Venmo and
that's exactly what we set out to do.
We're investing in high-impact growth initiatives that will move the needle and future-proofing the business with
critical partnership, while simultaneously returning value to shareholders through our buyback program and our
newly launched dividend.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call

28-Oct-2025

Steven Winoker
Chief Investor Relations Officer & Senior Vice President, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

Before we open the lines for Q&A, I'd like to ask everyone to limit themselves to one question so we can get
through as many of your fellow analysts as possible. Sarah, please open the line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with
JPMorgan. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Tien-Tsin Huang
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Q

Yeah, thanks a lot. Good morning, here. I just want to ask about Agentic Commerce. It's a popular topic here at
Money20/20 and I'm not sure how to ask it, Alex and team, but maybe I'll just rapid fire, if you don't mind. Has
Agentic Commerce changed PayPal strategic priorities in any way? What's your right to win? Can you fully fund
investments here without sacrificing your incremental margins? And of course, you've announced lot of key
partnerships like OpenAI today, Perplexity, Google, et cetera. Do you have the coverage you need to drive
ubiquity or is there more work to do on the partner front? Seems like there's a lot of talk about collaboration and
you guys are definitely in the center of all that. So, just love to hear your thoughts on all that, if you don't mind.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James Alexander Chriss
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

A

Love it. Thanks, Tien-Tsin, and hope you're enjoying Money20/20. We got a good contingent there as well. To hit
on a few of those. So first, from a prioritization – from a priority question, I'm not really, right? Our strategy we've
laid out very clearly is that we want PayPal to be available anywhere and everywhere that consumers want to
pay. And we want merchants to be able to sell to consumers anywhere and everywhere. And we talked about this
even back at Investor Day where we laid out – we want it to be online. We want it to be in-person and we want it
to be Agentic. And so Agentic is just an evolution of this strategy.
In terms of our right to win, we actually think we're extremely well-positioned to win here. Let me just lay out a
couple of the different components. So first, on the merchant side, merchants are going to need to figure out how
to integrate with each of these LLMs. And that's hard because there's multiple LLMs that are out there. And
whether you're a large enterprise or a small business, you really don't have the bandwidth to go figure out how to
integrate with each and every one of these LLMs, make your catalog available, understand the identity and fraud
protection that comes with each of these different elements.
And so, what we announced today was our PayPal Agentic Commerce Services, which enables merchants to
integrate once with PayPal, a partner that they've known and loved and integrated with for years and be able to
orchestrate their services to every LLM that's out there, so that they get full coverage of consumers. So that is a
huge win for merchants. We give them seller protection. We give them the ability to scale across all the different
LLMs.
From the consumer standpoint, we're, again, very well-positioned. We got – we have the largest wallet
ecosystems that are out there. And our ability to give consumers the trust, the safety, the buyer protection and the

28-Oct-2025

ability to get access and make purchases on any of the LLMs they want to is a huge win. They get to use the
wallet that they know and love and have a great end-to-end experience, which includes not only the purchase
through the LLM, but also then all the things that happen afterwards, whether it's package tracking or customer
service or returns. So that's again a big win for consumers.
And then for the LLMs themselves, it would take over a decade if they wanted to go and try to build the same kind
of merchant ecosystem of the head, the torso and tail of merchants that PayPal has established over the last
couple of decades. And so instead, they get to partner once with us, and get access to tens of millions of
merchants with identity, authentication, fraud protection and payment processing on a global scale.
And so, we really feel like we are connecting this ecosystem together. It will take time for Agentic to eat into
overall purchasing. But if you think about we want to meet customers where they are, online, offline, Agentic and
PayPal's in a very strong position there.
As far as investments, Jamie, do you want to hit on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jamie S. Miller

A

Chief Financial & Operating Officer, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

Sure. So, these partnerships do entail some level of investment, whether that's in product and tech or around comarketing, things that really drive usage and habituation around the product. And I mentioned in my prepared
remarks that we would be reinvesting – begin reinvesting some of our margin dollars in the fourth quarter to really
amplify some of our product initiatives. And between the push into Agentic and that – some of those investments
are likely to be a near-term headwind to how fast TM dollars or earnings grow next year. But we are really excited
about understanding what's working and really putting our dollars behind that in the core business in addition to
really advancing our initiatives across the business on things like Agentic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James Alexander Chriss

A

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

And the last part of your question was ubiquity. We obviously feel like we've got the largest breadth of merchants.
We obviously have the largest breadth of consumers. And now with the partnerships, we've already announced
OpenAI, Perplexity, Google and as we look to partner with any of the LLMs that are out there, we think we've got
actually quite good scale and ubiquity across the ecosystem. So very well-positioned to win as Agentic
Commerce continues to evolve.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call

28-Oct-2025

So I want to ask about branded. I know you highlighted some headwinds in the 5% growth number. You kind of
highlighted some kind of deceleration in the fourth quarter. But I'm also thinking, you have some benefit from Pay
with Venmo, and buy now, pay later promotion in the holiday season. So going back to the Investor Day, you kind
of laid out the path to branded acceleration. I know it's not linear. So, how should we think about just the overall
path from here? Or should we focus more on the slide 4, right, like that you highlighted, which is very helpful,
which kind of focuses on more diversified drivers of growth? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jamie S. Miller

A

Chief Financial & Operating Officer, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

Yes. Harshita, maybe I'll answer that in two parts. I'll talk about fourth quarter and then really talk about the
broader investor framework. We've had consistent mid-single-digit growth in branded checkout for multiple
quarters now. And for the quarter, we've seen really good momentum across our growth initiatives with buy now,
pay later, with Pay with Venmo. And we've seen continued US growth at higher rates as well this quarter.
When we got into September, we began to see macro-related deceleration. And that is both in the US and in
Europe. And I talked about it in my prepared remarks, but really a relatively consistent number of transactions, but
we're seeing basket sizes just trade down. Average order value being down, particularly in retail where
consumers are just being more selective. And that behavior has continued into October. So obviously, it's really
early in the fourth quarter. The holiday season is very back-end loaded. So it's something we're watching. But we
did call out, and you're right, our guidance assumes a rate of growth lower than of third quarter.
And so when you look at that macro and I pivot now to talking about the broader framework, we've seen very
good progress. And I think what I'm most excited about is we know what's working, and we're really doubling
down against that. And Alex has talked a lot about buy now, pay later. We've talked a lot about Pay with Venmo.
And importantly, year-to-date in the US, our growth rates are higher than what we saw year-to-date last year in
the US. So, we're really seeing nice progress. But that macro piece of it, whether its tariffs or some of this
deceleration is offsetting our progress. And we set those 2027 targets, assuming a strong – or assuming a
consistent consumer macro environment. And ultimately, that's how we'll measure progress against that.
What I am excited about is we have scaled our initiatives in the US first. And so where we see progress, we've got
real confidence as we scale outside of the US and internationally. I think we've invested in the right products.
We're seeing customer adoption and engagement around the things we've talked about in addition to things like
omni in places where we get other halo effect. And the investments we're making are really predicated on our
confidence in our ability to continue to build on our progress as we get through the next couple of years.

Dan Dolev
Analyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC

Q

Hey, guys. Great results as always. Just wanted to ask a quick question and a very, very short follow-up. So on
buy now, pay later, huge momentum here, can you maybe give us sort of lay of the land, like how you view, Alex,
the industry? Who are you gaining share from most and in what territories? And if I just have a super quick followup for you, Jamie, on the investments next year, if there's any way to quantify that that would be great, but those
are my questions. Thank you.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call

28-Oct-2025

James Alexander Chriss

A

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

Great. Thanks, Dan. And look, we're very excited about BNPL. We see this as one of those generational shifts
that's happening now. We're seeing not only in the results, but also just as we talk to customers, particularly a
younger generation is moving more and more towards debit and BNPLs, the way that they want to make
purchases. And we think we're incredibly well-positioned to win there.
As you said, we're seeing good growth. We're actually seeing growth across the board. US MAAs are up 21% in
Q3. TPV continuing to grow pretty consistently over 20%. And again, this is a product that people love. And NPS
of 80 is quite incredible.
And so from a strategy and a share perspective, we think we have something unique. We have a brand that
people know and love. We have a global scale, so not only seeing good gains in the US, but we continue to
expand our global footprint. It just expanded to Canada within the last week or so and continuing to expand the
offerings across the board and across Europe.
We're also moving to where our customers want to pay as well. So not just online, but moving in-store. We started
in Germany and now expanding that in the US. So we really see BNPL as one of those growth drivers for us.
The other big shift that I would want you to be aware of is most of our BNPL – and again, we're on track to do $40
billion or so of TPV in 2025, most of that has come almost after they've chosen the PayPal button choice. And for
many customers, that's actually too late. They want to make a choice upfront when they're making that purchase
and they want to see what that payment could look like if it was split into a few payments.
And so strategically, we're now meeting our customers where they are and think we have a really exciting
expansion opportunity to be upstream in presentment. Again, with a brand that people know and love, with a
product that they're already familiar with and using, when we get upstream into some of these purchases, we
think we have the opportunity to continue to accelerate. So very excited with BNPL and something that we're
going to invest in to win over the next few years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Chief Financial & Operating Officer, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

And Dan, with respect to the second part of your question, it's early. We are still working on our 2026 plan, and
we plan to take you through that on our February earnings call. When you look at the types of investments that
we're talking about, these are targeted really around product attach and habituation. So things like merchant comarketing, cash back offers and rewards, and things around better placement and presentment. So things that
drive right back into the business and around growth, but we'll have some more information for you on that in a
couple of months.

Sanjay Sakhrani
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

Q

Thank you. I want to dig into the really strong growth momentum at Venmo, where the revenues have been
consistently growing 20%. And Alex, you mentioned sort of the multiplier of upside from here. Could you maybe
map that out for us in terms of how we should think about the growth rate you've posted recently and what you
could do next year and beyond, given all the different initiatives you have in place inside of Venmo?

Q3 2025 Earnings Call

28-Oct-2025

James Alexander Chriss

A

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

Yeah. Thank you. We, Sanjay, are equally excited about the trajectory that Venmo is on. So let me just pull back
and talk a little bit about where Venmo was a couple of years ago and the contours of where we're moving.
So, Venmo a couple of years ago was an incredible P2P product, a brand in the US that was a verb. It was the
way a younger, very valuable demographic was moving money amongst themselves. So that was a very strong
starting position.
The challenge was we really weren't meeting customers where they are. Money was moving from a P2P
perspective. But then, again, if you were splitting a meal and you couldn't actually pay for that meal in person, you
had to use a different instrument.
We've expanded what Venmo means to this demographic. We're now meeting them where they are and enabling
them to make purchases in person, online, move money between each other as well as starting to think about
different experiences that they're having together, and I'll touch on that in a minute.
So if you look at what that means, it means that not only are we continuing to grow our active base, so MAAs up
7% year-over-year at $66 million. That's very strong. But now we're starting to see real penetration into two of our
monetization levers. So debit card MAAs are up 43%. Pay with Venmo MAAs are up 24%. And this is starting to
drive ARPA up. So ARPA's up mid-teens year-to-date.
When you put all of that together, I still feel like we're just scratching the surface. If I look at us versus peers from
an ARPA perspective, we are a third to a quarter of what I believe our potential is over time, and we're starting to
now see really good adoption of the cards that we're putting in, the debit card and Pay with Venmo. So, again, all
of the trajectory is moving in the right direction.
And then what you're going to start to see on top of that is new products and services coming in. So the way that
we've talked about it is, Venmo is a social product. It's the product that you're using oftentimes with other people.
So you look at the announcement that we made yesterday with Bilt to be able to make rent and mortgage
payments. Oftentimes, this is a demographic where they're making rent payments because they're living with
others. And they were using Venmo after the fact to move money across. Now we're enabling them to make their
rent payments and split their rent payments upfront with that kind of partnership. You're going to see more of
those types of things from us over the coming months, as we start to think about all of those experiences that this
incredible demographic is using to be able to move money across.
And so again, we think we're just scratching the surface of the ARPA that's available. We have good proof points
of the monetization levers of debit card, Pay with Venmo and now we're expanding into other experiences where
folks can go. And our go-to-market campaigns are working as well. You've seen the success of the college
partnerships that we put out, that drove over 1 million FTUs of debit card in Q3 alone.
So again, really, really excited about where this is going, and it's starting to bring in very, very valuable merchants
as well. So whether it's eBay or Ticketmaster, Sephora, Taco Bell, DoorDash, TikTok, these are all merchants
that really want access to this demographic and Venmo is the best way to get access to them. So just getting
started, excited about the growth trajectory, and we expect this to continue well into the future.

Darrin Peller
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC

Q

Hey, guys. Thanks. Congrats on the OpenAI and the dividend announcements. I just want to touch on the exit
growth rate of the year for a minute. I know you're guiding 2% to 5% for transaction margin growth. So maybe the
puts and takes of what that could compare when you think about trending into 2026 and how we should think
about next year in the context of the exit rate?
And then maybe just, I know you talked about investments being made, obviously, for all these initiatives. So how
does that impact our thought process on operating leverage and just overall investment EPS potentially for next
year as well? Whatever you can comment, I know it's early. Thanks, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jamie S. Miller

A

Chief Financial & Operating Officer, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

Yeah. Good morning, Darrin. I'll stay away from giving 2026 guidance, but I will give you some color on the fourth
quarter transaction margin dollars and what we expect to see there. To some level, we got some impact from
interest rate cuts coming in the fourth quarter. But really, in the credit business, we got tougher comps. You may
remember that we really got that business back to growth in the fourth quarter of last year. And so we just have
tougher comps coming into the fourth quarter this year.
And I mentioned some level of investments and growth initiatives as well. And with what we're seeing on macro,
we want to be prudent in terms of how we guide there. And then across the portfolio, the product initiatives, I think
what's probably important to call out is that some of this goes through transaction margin dollars, other parts go
through OpEx. I mean things like investment in product and tech and brand marketing, things like that, go through
OpEx. So as we work our plan, we work across all of that to really get to the right mix as we get into it. So we'll
take you through more in a couple of months, but hopefully that's some color for you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James Alexander Chriss

A

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

Hey, Darrin, I want to – without going into the details for next year, I do though want to set a mindset for us
because this is what we're thinking about internally. I've mentioned and we talked about it so far on this call, a
couple of big shifts that we see in the market, and I want to call that out.
We see three pretty significant generational shifts right now. One is a massive shift to digital wallets and this is
globally.
The second is a real shift to buy now, pay later. Again, a younger generation and that's now moving the way
they're spending. And this we think can start to take share away from credit cards and be the way that this new
generation is going to start to pay. And then the third shift we talked about is towards Agentic Commerce.
These are all three massive shifts that can recast the entire commerce landscape, and we think we're extremely
well-positioned in all three of them. If you look at digital wallets, we have leading wallets such as PayPal and
Venmo we just talked about. And we have our expansion into PayPal World, which continues to connect wallets
around the world.

Q3 2025 Earnings Call

28-Oct-2025

In buy now, pay later, we just talked about upstream presentment. We talked about the expansion and the
trajectory we have there. And then we talked earlier about Agentic Commerce and the shift that's happening and
our ability to lean in and win.
The mindset that we have from a company is these are generational shifts that we are well-positioned, and we
must win in. And so we are going to invest appropriately. Those investments may very well lead to some nearterm headwinds in how fast TM and earnings grow in 2026. We'll come back with more details as we think
through that. But again, our goal is to win these markets and set ourselves up for faster durable growth in the
future across all of commerce. So I just wanted to set that tone.

Operator: The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jason Kupferberg

Q

Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities

Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So you obviously had a nice beat here on TM dollars in the
quarter. It seems like the branded business came in right in line with your expectations. The OVAS revenues were
quite strong. So I wanted to just unpack the sources of TM upside in the quarter a bit, if you can give us a relative
sense on how much of that upside came from the credit products versus some of the other drivers? And then just
any quick comments on how you see cadence of additional penetration of the new checkout experience moving
beyond the 25% level as we move into next year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jamie S. Miller

A

Chief Financial & Operating Officer, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

Thanks, Jason. Good morning. Really, when you look at third quarter transaction margin dollar performance, we
had meaningful contribution across each of branded checkout, Venmo, PSP, VAS and credit. And I think what's
important there, and we really tried to highlight this in our prepared remarks as well is that we've got nice
diversification not only on the revenue side, but on the margin sources. And I think that's demonstrative of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James Alexander Chriss

A

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

Yeah. And on the penetration, we talked a little bit about it. But again, just to set the tone, we really started in the
US. We now are roughly 25% of global transactions. Even under that 25%, though, about half are actually
optimized. And so we're really working through how do we nail the overall paysheet improvement, the biometrics
that we're starting to put together. When all of that comes together, the paysheet and the biometrics, we're
actually seeing conversion rates increase 2% to 5%. So we know we have a winning product. It just is taking time.
And look, I'm as impatient as anyone, I want to see this move as fast as we can, but we're talking about bending
the curve on over $0.5 trillion of spend, and it's just taking time to get there. So we have confidence, as Jamie
mentioned earlier, US branded checkout is growing faster year-to-date than it did in 2024. So we know the
experiences are working. We're now rolling it out in Europe. We expect that to continue through 2026. And in the
meantime, we're leaning into BNPL growing north of 20%, Pay with Venmo growing north of 40%. And so we
know that overall, in branded checkout, we're on the right path, it's just taking time.

Q

Hey, appreciate you taking the question. I mean I wanted to dig in a little bit on the BNPL volumes. So just a
couple questions here. I guess, first, if you could just quantify some of the run rate financial impact you're
expecting on the Blue Owl offloading, I guess just – and any help with the geography of those impacts on the P&L
as we think about that going forward?
And then just maybe a big picture question on the BNPL growth, obviously very strong. I think you said in the past
that the branded numbers or the branded volumes are roughly 40% US, 60% international. Do the BNPL volumes
skew meaningfully differently? And just any color on what you're seeing from a geographical perspective in terms
of adoption and penetration of branded volumes in BNPL? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

James Alexander Chriss
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

A

Yeah. So let me take that second part and then Jamie can lean in. So BNPL, right now, we're looking at less than
30% of originations in the US. So this is still a very global business. But it's one where, as I mentioned earlier,
what we're excited about is really an expansion of our strategy into upstream presentment. We think that's going
to be a big, big shift and opportunity for us as well as a change as we start to expand into omnichannel.
And so being able to move buy now, pay later into in-store. It's interesting the dynamics of how we're seeing
people shop is it's not just hard lines of in-store or e-commerce. There's a lot of people that are shopping on their
phone and then wanting to pick up in store, and that's where they get the opportunity to do their buy now, pay
later purchase. So all of this is coming together in a holistic product.
And again, we're seeing the flywheel effect of BNPL as well. When somebody starts to leverage BNPL, there's a
lift in engagement, their TPV is up 35%, and we start to see their ability to use us for all purchases. And so this is
– it's very interesting just to see the dynamics of purchase behavior. I think in the past, as e-commerce and
commerce in general was evolving, there were much harder lines.
What we're seeing from customers now is they want to pay when they want to pay. Sometimes it's pay now,
sometimes it's pay later. Where they want to pay? Online, in-store or Agentic and how they want to pay, whether
it's with their friends, whether it's with crypto, whether it's the wallet from their home country. And we're – now
have a strategy that enables to meet them everywhere they are. So exciting trajectory there. And again, you're
going to see us lean in even more into BNPL over the coming years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Jamie S. Miller
Chief Financial & Operating Officer, PayPal Holdings, Inc.

A

Yeah. And with respect to the first part of your question on Blue Owl, we had a small impact in the quarter, but
that was net neutral to operating income, which both raised margin a bit, but also was offset in OpEx. And with
respect to 2026, there's a small impacts – a small impact to 2026 OpEx in terms of increasing the run rate.

Great. Thank you. I think we've covered some great numbers on the BNPL business today. I was hoping we could
round it out with a few more, and this would help us in comparability to some of the competitors at Affirm and
Klarna. I was hoping you could give a little bit on the mix of Pay in 4 versus some of your longer-term Pay Monthly
loans. Also maybe touch on the loss rates. And then what I think investors really want to get down to is balancing
those losses and potentially more favorable funding mix for the repayment. What really is the transaction margin
dollar net take rate per unit of BNPL volume so that we could compare that to metrics like RLTC as a percentage
of GMV for Affirm? Thanks.

Good morning, Tim. You've packed a lot into that. So I'm hoping I remember it all. Let me start with sort of
thinking about unit economics on the core product. And first, with respect to what type of product is it, most of this
is Pay in 4, Pay Monthly. We've got about an average turn on the portfolio of buy now, pay later over about 40
days. So when you think about that compared to peers, it is – the duration of the portfolio is a much higher turn
than maybe some of the others you look at.
Secondly, as we price it, our economics are on par or better than our peers. And – but I – the thing I'd really point
you to here is when we look at BNPL, we do run it at the business level, but we look at it much more holistically at
the total branded checkout or PayPal level, around how do we habituate and engage our consumers around the
brand and across the brand and drive sustained lift or a halo across that with BNPL adoption. It just drives
stickiness.
And we really see a 30% to 40%, sort of, incremental usage of branded checkout and that stays with us as the
consumer continues to spend with BNPL. We're expanding through new geographies, as Alex mentioned, really
focused on driving consumer experience and marketing dollars. But hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color as
to how to compare.

Yeah. So, thank you, everyone, for your questions. As you can hear from us, it is an exciting time at PayPal. We
mentioned some of these significant generational shifts. And that makes it exciting to be at the forefront and a
leader in this space. So, we've got the right plan. We're making great progress and delivering results along the
way, and I look forward to updating you as we continue to make progress. Take care, everyone.
