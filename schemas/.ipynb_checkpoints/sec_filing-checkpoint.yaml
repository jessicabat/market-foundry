  instruction: >
    Extract risk factors and material financial drivers from this SEC filing.
    Focus heavily on "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis" logic.

    CRITICAL RULES:
    1. Capture risks: (business_model, at_risk_from, regulation/competition).
    2. Capture material impacts: (event, could_materially_adversely_affect, result).
    3. Capture legal/regulatory dependencies.
    4. Ignore boilerplate table of contents or signatures.

    Examples:
    - Text: "New data privacy laws could increase our compliance costs."
      -> (data privacy laws, could_increase, compliance costs)
    - Text: "Reliance on a single supplier poses a material risk to production."
      -> (production, at_risk_from, reliance on single supplier)
