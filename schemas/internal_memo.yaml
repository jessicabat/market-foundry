  instruction: >
    Extract general causal relationships and key entities from this financial document.
    Since the document type is broad, focus on any explicit "A causes B" or "A leads to B" statements.

    CRITICAL RULES:
    1. Capture any cause-effect: (cause, causes, effect).
    2. Capture key metrics: (metric, increased/decreased, amount).
    3. Capture entities: (person, role, company).
    4. Avoid vague triples; stick to explicit text evidence.
