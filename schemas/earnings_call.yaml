extraction:
  task: Triple
  instruction: >
    You are an expert financial analyst. Extract factual causal triples from this earnings call transcript.
    Focus on WHY metrics changed (drivers) and WHAT is expected next (guidance).

    CRITICAL RULES:
    1. Extract explicit causal links: (cause, driven_by, factor), (action, results_in, outcome).
    2. Capture guidance: (company, forecasts, metric), (metric, expected_to, value).
    3. Link segment performance: (segment, grew_due_to, driver).
    4. Ignore "Operator" instructions. Focus on Executives and Analyst Q&A.
    5. Lowercase everything. Head/Tail max 15 words.

    Examples:
    - Text: "Revenue grew 10% driven by strong AI demand."
      -> (revenue growth, driven_by, ai demand)
    - Text: "We expect Q4 margins to compress due to higher cloud costs."
      -> (q4 margins, expected_to_compress_due_to, higher cloud costs)
