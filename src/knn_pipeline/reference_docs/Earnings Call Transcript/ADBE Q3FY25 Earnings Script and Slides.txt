AI represents a tectonic technology shift and presents the biggest opportunity for Adobe in decades. Our
strategy to harness AI is focused on infusing it across our category-leading applications to provide more
value and delivering innovative new AI-ﬁrst products. We’ve done a great job executing this strategy by
accelerating innovation with a focus on oﬀering greater value to Creative and Marketing Professionals
Creativity has always been core to the company’s mission. We’re infusing AI across our ﬂagship Creative
Cloud applications including Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and After Eﬀects and delivering new
oﬀerings for next generation creators with Adobe Fireﬂy across web and mobile.

We're delivering an end-to-end, ideation-to-creation solution in the new Fireﬂy application to
make it the single destination for creators’ workﬂows. It includes our own ﬁrst-party,
commercially safe models and leading third-party models. We are seeing strong adoption of the

We recently added Google Gemini Flash 2.5 alongside Google’s Veo and Imagen models to the
roster of partner models from OpenAI, Black Forest Labs, Runway, Pika, Ideogram and others. In
the rapidly evolving AI landscape, where each generative AI model has its own aesthetic style,
we’re oﬀering customers choice and ﬂexibility to use the right model within Adobe applications,

AI is now deeply integrated across our ﬂagship applications in Creative Cloud, giving creators
everything they need to bring their creative visions to life all in one workﬂow. We’re seeing
strong adoption of the Creative Cloud Pro oﬀering which includes Fireﬂy, reﬂecting the value

Customers are leveraging the rich data and customer knowledge in Adobe Experience Platform to enable
agentic workﬂows to scale the capabilities of Adobe’s category-leading customer experience
Platform (AEP) AI Assistant with 70 percent of eligible AEP customers leveraging this functionality.

As AI transforms consumer behavior, it’s reinventing marketing and customer experience. Brand
discovery is shifting from primarily search to include generative engine optimization. AI becomes
the new UI, guided by conversations rather than menu clicks. Brands must deliver hyperpersonalized, immersive experiences on owned channels to drive engagement and loyalty. In this
new reality, Adobe uniquely oﬀers an integrated customer experience platform that delivers

The explosion of content creation and automation in the enterprise and the beginning of new
marketing needs such as LLM optimization and LLM advertising are a massive opportunity for
Adobe. We’re infusing AI into Adobe Experience Manager with our upcoming LLM Optimizer
release, a powerful agentic app to improve brand visibility, drive acquisition and maintain

For Business Professionals and Consumers, we’re integrating creativity with productivity for billions of
users with the recent launch of Acrobat Studio, which brings together Acrobat and Express.

PDF has been the global standard for digital documents for over 30 years and continues to grow.
We’re evolving Acrobat from a leading document productivity app to a ﬁrst-of-its

The new Acrobat Studio includes PDF Spaces, which transforms collections of PDFs, web pages

billion, up from over $3.5 billion exiting ﬁscal year 2024 and we have already surpassed our full year AIﬁrst ending ARR target. Given our customer-focused growth strategy, product innovation and strong goto-market execution and the momentum in our business, we’re pleased to once again raise our FY25
I'll now turn it over to David and Anil to discuss the momentum in our business.

DAVID WADHWANI

In Q3, Digital Media achieved revenue of $4.46 billion, which grew 11 percent year over year. We exited
the quarter with $18.59 billion of Digital Media ARR, growing ending ARR 11.7 percent year over year.

introduction of Acrobat AI Assistant brought a new conversational interface that enhances the
experience of customers consuming PDFs. This unlocks increased comprehension across the trillions of
PDFs in the world. We continue to see accelerated use of AI Assistant across desktop, web and mobile.
Our vision is to harness the power of generative AI and conversational experiences to fundamentally
reshape how knowledge is discovered, synthesized and shared. We’re executing on our strategy to
extend the role of PDF and Acrobat by delivering a cohesive experience that empowers individuals to
eﬀortlessly move from content consumption in Acrobat to content creation in Express.
We’ve expanded our strategy with the introduction of PDF Spaces, a new foundation for content
static ﬁles into dynamic, collaborative knowledge hubs. Users can leverage PDF Spaces to organize
documents and links, discover insights faster through conversational experiences and enable editing and
remixing of PDF content into new formats like emails and presentations. I’m particularly excited that
anyone can easily create agents to perform document tasks on their behalf. Customers can use PDF
Spaces with team members for more impactful knowledge sharing and collaboration. The combination
of PDF Spaces, AI Assistant and an integrated Express experience is available through Acrobat Studio, a
new, premium oﬀer in our Acrobat line-up. Early reception of Acrobat Studio has been strong, with
encouraging adoption and usage trends that highlight the signiﬁcant customer demand and opportunity
ahead.

We’re seeing rapid adoption of Adobe Express. In the enterprise, Express is helping organizations scale
content creation while maintaining brand consistency and quality. A great example is dentsu, which has
made Express a core part of its global marketing strategy. Adobe’s platform is being rolled out to all
68,000 employees worldwide and scaled across brands including Carat, iProspect, dentsu X, Dentsu
Creative, Tag and Merkle. By enabling creative teams to build content in Creative Cloud and share that
content through Express within an overall GenStudio solution, dentsu ensures brand alignment across
global teams while empowering marketers to create and remix their own content. This is driving

Our Creative Business had a strong quarter. Creativity has never been more important, and we continue
to lead by delivering the next generation of innovations to empower Creative Professionals and
Creators. As demand for content accelerates, our strategy is centered on making creativity more
accessible, more intelligent and more impactful. We are doing this by deeply integrating AI into our
ﬂagship applications, expanding creativity through new apps like Fireﬂy and providing powerful
automation to help customers scale their work. Together, these innovations are transforming how ideas
move from inspiration to execution and helping our customers create with greater speed, eﬃciency and
imagination.
We are continuing to infuse AI into our ﬂagship applications like Photoshop, Premiere Pro and Illustrator
to help onboard new users more quickly and make existing users far more productive. Recent examples
include the addition of a new Harmonize feature in Photoshop that blends composited objects with the
image by automatically adjusting lighting, colors and shadows. Harmonize has quickly become one of the
most used features in Photoshop. We released Project Turntable, a popular sneak from MAX last year,
into Illustrator, which helps users rotate their 2D artwork to accurately visualize diﬀerent angles,
eliminating a frequent and time-consuming task. Innovations like these directly translate into
measurable value for customers by cutting production times, enabling more content output, and raising
the overall quality of creative work and have driven strong migration to our new Creative Cloud Pro oﬀer.
The Fireﬂy app is a powerful, yet accessible AI production studio that helps creators deliver original
content faster than ever before. In Q3, we added a slew of new capabilities, including avatar generation,
sound eﬀects generation and updates to the growing list of integrated generative models. Fireﬂy
provides access to Adobe’s commercially safe generative AI models alongside a growing list of leading

10

third-party models, including Google’s Imagen, Veo and Gemini Flash 2.5, OpenAI’s GPT-image as well as,
Flux, Runway, Ideogram, Pika and Ray2, to name a few. This is enabling the Fireﬂy app to be the go-to
destination for content generation and editing for both creators using Adobe products for the ﬁrst time

well as oﬀerings with Amazon Ads, Google Campaign Manager 360, LinkedIn and Meta to power
We are innovating on our leading AEP marketing and customer experience platform with built-in agentic
functionality, empowering marketers to deliver digital experiences with greater agility and eﬃciency. Our
intelligent agents understand intent, reason and recommend actions to drive outcomes across content,
data, and journeys. Purpose-built agents are embedded in our core apps and new AI-ﬁrst applications,
helping brands unlock greater eﬃciency and precision, automate workﬂows and personalize experiences
at scale. We launched the ﬁrst phase of AEP Agent Orchestrator in Q3, empowering businesses to build,
manage and orchestrate AI agents from Adobe and third parties. These capabilities power the Data
Insights Agent and Product Support Agent, which are generally available now and add to our growing
Our newest innovation is Adobe LLM Optimizer, available in early access. As customers and prospects
