Abstract 
Financial stress testing is crucial in today's complex and data-intensive financial environment. 
Traditional risk assessment methods, including analytical, technical, and heuristic models, often 
fail to capture the intricate dependencies within financial systems. This research introduces a deep 
learning-based framework for financial stress testing, leveraging Correlation based Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CCNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance risk 
prediction accuracy. By integrating quantitative and qualitative financial indicators, the proposed 
model delivers improved stability and precision. Experimental results indicate a significant 
reduction in training and testing loss, with final values of 0.0013 and 0.003, respectively. The 
model effectively estimates key financial metrics such as revenue, net income, and earnings per 
share (EPS) with high alignment to actual values. Moreover, the framework substantially mitigates 
financial risks, reducing credit risk from 0.75 to 0.20, liquidity risk from 0.70 to 0.25, market risk 
from 0.65 to 0.30, and operational risk from 0.80 to 0.35. These findings suggest that deep 
learning-driven financial stress testing enhances risk assessment, strengthens financial resilience, 
and supports more informed decision-making in modern financial markets.

Memory and Financial Stability. 

1. Introduction 
Financial institutions operate in an increasingly volatile and complex environment, requiring 
robust mechanisms to assess and mitigate risks. The unpredictability of economic cycles, 
geopolitical tensions, and rapid technological advancements have amplified financial risks, 
making traditional risk management strategies insufficient [1]. Financial stress testing has emerged 
as a crucial tool for assessing an institutions resilience to adverse conditions by simulating various 
economic and financial scenarios. Regulatory bodies such as the Federal Reserve, European 
Central Bank (ECB), and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision mandate stress testing 
frameworks to ensure financial stability and prevent systemic crises. Traditional risk assessment 
techniques, including statistical models, expert-based heuristics, and rule-based approaches, have 
long been the foundation of financial stress testing [2]. However, these methods struggle with 
handling the complexity, volume, and velocity of financial data, limiting their effectiveness in 
predicting financial distress [3,4]. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning, 
financial stress testing has undergone a paradigm shift, leveraging advanced computational 
techniques to enhance risk prediction accuracy. Deep learning models, particularly Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, excel in capturing 
intricate patterns and temporal dependencies in financial data. CNNs are effective in extracting 
meaningful features from structured and unstructured data, while LSTMs specialize in sequential 
data processing, making them ideal for time-series financial analysis. This research introduces a 
deep learning-based framework for financial stress testing, integrating CNN and LSTM networks 
to improve risk assessment. By combining quantitative financial indicators with qualitative 
insights from financial statements and market trends, the proposed model enhances predictive 
performance and stability. 
Experimental findings demonstrate a significant reduction in financial risks, with credit risk 
decreasing from 0.75 to 0.20, liquidity risk from 0.70 to 0.25, market risk from 0.65 to 0.30, and 
operational risk from 0.80 to 0.35. Additionally, key financial metrics such as revenue, net income, 
and earnings per share (EPS) exhibit high alignment with actual values, reinforcing the models 
reliability. The adoption of deep learning in financial stress testing not only enhances risk 
management strategies but also supports regulatory compliance and financial resilience. This study 
contributes to the growing field of AI-driven financial analytics by demonstrating how deep 
learning can transform risk assessment, optimize decision-making, and strengthen financial 
institutions' preparedness against economic uncertainties. 

2. Literature Survey 
Financial risk management has evolved significantly with advancements in artificial intelligence 
(AI) and machine learning (ML), particularly in deep learning-driven models for stress testing and 
predictive analytics. Traditional methods often rely on statistical and rule-based models, which 
have limitations in handling the complexity and uncertainty of financial data. Recent studies 
emphasize the role of AI, particularly deep learning, in enhancing risk prediction accuracy and 
financial stability. 
[5] explores the impact of technology-driven financial risk management, particularly in non-profit 
organizations, emphasizing the role of machine learning in improving risk assessment and

decision-making. The study highlights how AI-based models enhance the ability to analyze 
financial statements, identify hidden patterns, and mitigate risks in volatile economic conditions. 
Similarly, Oko-Odion et al. (2025) discuss the transformation of financial risk assessment through 
deep learning-based business analytics. The study demonstrates how AI-driven techniques 
optimize return on investment (ROI) and enhance financial resilience by leveraging predictive 
models that identify risks in real time. 
[6] provide a comprehensive overview of stress test designs for AI and ML models under shifting 
financial conditions. The research highlights the necessity of evaluating model robustness in 
fluctuating economic scenarios, ensuring that predictive models maintain reliability even in crises. 
The study underscores the importance of integrating adaptive machine learning techniques in 
financial stress testing to enhance model performance and regulatory compliance.[7] focus on the 
role of AI and ML in financial risk management, emphasizing their potential to automate complex 
risk assessment processes. Their work, later published in Disrupting Finance (2019), illustrates 
how AI can be integrated into financial strategies, improving the precision of risk forecasting and 
stress testing. 
Additionally, [8,9] investigates the application of ML in financial risk management, emphasizing 
the efficiency of AI-based techniques in handling large-scale financial data. The study examines 
various machine learning models, including deep learning architectures, and their ability to 
improve financial forecasting and risk evaluation. The findings support the argument that AI-
driven financial stress testing frameworks enhance the accuracy of risk assessments while reducing 
human intervention. 
These studies collectively highlight the growing reliance on deep learning for financial risk 
management. The integration of CNN and LSTM networks has been particularly effective in 
capturing intricate financial patterns and predicting risks more accurately than conventional 
models. While existing research provides a strong foundation for AI-based financial risk 
assessment, this study extends the literature by proposing a hybrid deep learning model for 
financial stress testing. By combining CNN and LSTM architectures, the proposed framework 
aims to improve financial risk prediction, optimize stress testing, and support decision-making in 
modern financial markets. 

3. Proposed Correlation based Convolutional Neural Networks Methodology with LSTM 
Along with details on the collection of data, preprocessing of texts, and the newly created deep 
learning algorithm for risk assessment and prediction, this part also outlines the overall study 
approach. The ontological evolution of the suggested CCNN model follows these phases, as seen 
in Fig. 1. The corresponding automation process includes procedures for data pre-processing along 
with the aggregation of financial information [10,11], such as stemmed or lemmatisation, 
tokenisation, and stopping word elimination. After the previously processed information has been 
received, it is vectorised and processed with the CNN-LSTM algorithm. The training procedure 
comes next, nevertheless initially three thick layers are being used. Step-by-step loss optimisation 
and computation take place throughout the training phase. The effectiveness of the methods for 
managing risks is then assessed by testing the model that was learnt using a variety of indicators 
and analysing outcomes.

 Figure 1: Workflow details for proposed model 
Developing an CCNN that makes use of DL neural network models for improved financial risk 
assessments is the main goal of this study. The suggested CCNN model handles both linguistic 
and numerical information from financial statements by combining both LSTM and CNN systems. 
The goal of this hybrid design is to take use of each neural net type's advantages. CNNs are very 
good at gleaning important characteristics from unorganised textual information such financial 
filings. When dealing with sequential numerical information, such as a sequence of financial 
measurements, LSTMs are good at identifying periodic correlations [12]. 
By combining several DL approaches, a thorough method of forecasting risks is provided, 
addressing the high-dimensionality and quantity of economic data. The journal's emphasis on 
creative uses of AI neural networks to process linguistic and quantitative information from 
financial documents is in line with this concept. The goal of this hybrid design is to take use of 
each neural network type's advantages. CNNs are very good at gleaning important characteristics 
from unorganised textual information such financial filings. 
Temporal relationships in sequence mathematical information, such as time series of financial 
measures, may be effectively captured using LSTMs. By combining several DL approaches, a 
thorough method of forecasting risk is provided, addressing the high-dimensionality and intricate 
nature of accounting data. The approach is in line with the journal's emphasis on cutting-edge

applications of artificial intelligence in financial risk mitigation. Previous research has examined 
the use of DL in managing financial risks. Although earlier research has looked into DL functions. 
3.1 Contributions and understanding gaps 
Current financial risk algorithms rely on statistical approaches or single-modality artificial neural 
networks, which include CNN for processing text or LSTM for data with numbers. These 
techniques are inherently limited: 
1) Insufficient text analysis: Semantic details within intricate, unorganised text information seen 
in statements of earnings is often not extracted by traditional algorithms. 
2) Lack of temporal perception: Low-quality risk evaluations result from models that just use 
numerical information, which often overlook the contextual subtleties included in texts. 
3) Scalability problems: Since many models are created for certain financial situations, they could 
not translate well to other sectors of the economy or industry. 
To solve these problems, the CCNN model does the following. processing verbal and numerical 
info concurrently through utilising the advantages of CNN and LSTM. increasing the model's 
capacity to understand quantitative risk variables by extracting features from financial documents 
using sophisticated NLP methods. putting in place a scalable system that can adjust to various 
financial information sets, increasing the forecasts' generalisability. A significant gap in the state 
of financial danger assessment is filled by this integrated method, which offers a single model that 
can capture complex interactions across several model. 
3.2 Technology for computing 
Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, the OS included in the computer's setup, offers a reliable and effective 
foundation for a range of activities. The machine in question has an Intel Core installed. 32 GB of 
RAM and an i7-9700K CPU operating at 3.60 GHz provide seamless processing and excellent 
efficiency. To process graphics, it makes use of an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070. Jupyter Notebook 
for collaborative calculating, Anaconda Distributor for installation and administration of 
environments, and Python 3.8 for coding are all part of the application configuration. 
3.3 Architecture explanation 
 The CNN and LSTM systems serve as the foundation for the suggested model.The main use of 
convolutional neural networks (CNN) is the extraction of features from textual material. Through 
the use of layer convolution, they are successful in finding and understanding connections in the 
data. Multiple convolutional layer and layers of pooling make up the CNN portion of the model, 
which aids in lowering the size of the input while maintaining significant characteristics. 
Networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) are used to record temporal relationships in data. 
They are very helpful with sequential information and are capable of managing dependence on it 
over time well. The LSTM structure uses several cells to preserve data over time, crucial for 
comprehending financial articles. 
Combining CNN and LSTM: Combining CNN and LSTM systems taps on their strengths. While 
LSTM is excellent at capturing chronological connections, CNN is very good at extracting features 
from textual information. In order to handle both the quantitative and qualitative components of 
financial information and provide a more thorough evaluation of risks, the hybrid modelknown 
as CCNNwas especially created. 
Evaluation: To guarantee the model's dependability, traditional measures like precision, recall, and 
F1-score are used to assess its performance. In order to adjust variables and avoid over fitting, the 
framework is also verified on an independent database.

Written and quantitative information constitute the two separate input streams that the process 
starts with, as shown in Figure 1. Before submitting it for evaluation, textual information is 
preprocessed using techniques including lemmatisation, formation, stopping word elimination, and 
tokenisation. In order to extract significant semantic information, this preprocessed text is further 
vectorised and run through CNN levels. In parallel, LSTM algorithms are fed numerical 
information, usually organised as economic indicators, which are able to identify patterns and 
temporal relationships in the information. The algorithm may then use insights from both verbal 
and numeric information since the features that were taken out of the CNN and LSTM layers are 
integrated into a single attribute presentation. For further improvement and decision-making, this 
unified representation undergoes processing via a number of thick layers. GANs are used to 
generate artificial information to improve the accuracy of training and increase system resilience 
and reduce information shortages. Furthermore, RL is used to rapidly alter the model in response 
to evolving market circumstances, guaranteeing ongoing forecast improvement. Ultimately, risk 
measures are produced using the improved characteristics, leading to precise and thorough risk 
assessment forecasts. This integrated method offers comprehensive financial risk assessments 
using several deep learning approaches. 
3.4 Detailed risk assessment of financial reporting with hybridized deep learning models 
Develop a deep neural network system combining CNN and LSTM qualities with accounting word 
and numbers. The goal is to explicitly build an algorithm that can recognise financial hazards and 
possible interdependencies between many different factors in the information at hand. The Hybrid 
Financial Danger Prediction (CCNN) model combines CNN and LSTM systems to analyse 
numbers and language in accounts for money. Two elements make up the source information 
representations: T, an integer tensor of size n *p *q for textual information taken from the financial 
statements, and X, a matrix containing mathematical properties of size n *m. The linguistic 
information features are extracted using the CNN. Convolution procedures utilising filter values 
(Wconv) and biases (bconv), accompanied by an activation function (r), produce mappings of 
features (Fi CNN). In order to detect possible danger indicators, this technique extracts substantial 
trends and semantic details from the written data.

This is an example of the CCNN model's goal functions. Its elements guarantee that a template

Using CNN for textual and LSTM for numerical information, this approach creates a hybrid 
representation for features. To make the optimisation more challenging, the goal variable 
additionally includes L2 regularisation, L1 regularisation, and the average squared error.

learning

Using new information, we suggest a new risk forecasting system which might integrate deep 
reinforcement learning (DRL) with conventional machine learning (ML). The theoretical 
framework will modify insurance strategies in light of a changing market environment.

Deep learning and DRL are used in the preceding statement to create a dynamic algorithm that 
may be trained from fresh financial information as well as existing feeds. In other words, the policy 
and value network are trained to get the most suitable risk management options at the necessary 
degree of precision and as an intelligent purchase. 
With its concealed states, the LSTM network's algorithm can identify periodic connections and 
patterns in numerical values. To calculate the secret state at the time t (ht), input data (xt), prior 
hidden condition (ht - 1), and weight matrices (Wh and Uh) are used. This method enables the 
framework to effectively analyse longitudinal data, such as financial measures, by retaining 
relevant details across extended periods. A unified characteristic vector (F i), which represents an 
extensive joint set of characteristics that incorporates insights obtained from textual and numerical 
data, is subsequently created by combining the derived characteristics obtained from CNN and 
LSTM. 
The model's goal function is developed to reduce error in forecasting while avoiding excessive 
fitting by using regularisation elements. Three parts make up the loss operate: the average squared 
error among the actual and anticipated values, L2 regularisation term to penalise high weight 
numbers, and L1 regularisation term to promote sparseness in the parameter set. The forecasting 
function then uses output weights (Wout) and biassed (bout) to apply a linear change, producing the 
final risk forecast (yi) depending on the composite visualisation of features. 
3.6 GAN-based multimodal risk management evaluation 
To improve prediction accuracy, suggest a multi-modal risk estimation regarding money GAN for 
creating artificial information. It is anticipated that the framework would address information 
shortage issues while simultaneously enhancing risk estimation effectiveness.

network of discriminators. A random noise input vector is fed into the generator (see Eq. (14)), 
which uses a number of weight matrix structures, biases, and functions for activation to alter it. A 
computer program that attempts to mimic real-life financial information is produced by this 
procedure. Conversely, the discriminator (see Eq. (15)) assesses both created and actual data. After 
applying an alteration procedure with weights and biases, it generates an accuracy score indicating 
genuine or synthetic data. An antagonistic loss coefficient is used in the GAN's training phase (see 
Eq. (16)). In this case, the machine that discriminates seeks to maximise its capacity to accurately

discern between actual and artificial information, while the engine seeks to minimise its demise 
by producing genuine information. The generator is guaranteed to continuously enhance the 
accuracy of the artificial information thanks to this adversarial design. The model uses an 
activation function that is generated after applying a linear adjustment to the pooled parameters 
using a combination of weights and prejudices in order to forecast risk in finance. On the basis of 
these modifications, the infrastructure produces the anticipated risk values. comprises a set of 
networks for forecasting risks (see Eq. (17)), 
 Three parts make up this decrease in operate: The average squared error between real and 
anticipated values, a measure of error for differences in the forecasts of artificial information, and 
regularisation penalty to guarantee the reliability of the model. When combined, these components 
help create a paradigm for risk evaluation and forecasting that works. This formulation synthesises 
financial information using GANs and lowers the issue of inadequate data and improves the 
precision of risk forecasting. The amalgamated risk increases the reliability of the risk forecasting 
system, while the loss caused by adversary ensures that the synthesised information is realistic. 
The methodology also has a GAN feature for financial information synthesis, which improves 
model resilience and tackles limited data challenges. The discriminating networks (D D), which 
distinguishes between produced and actual information, and the generation networks (G), which 
creates artificial information, make up the GAN. By optimising both networks, the competing loss 
functions makes sure that the produced information closely resembles the original data. By using 
both artificial and actual data, the risk prediction network minimises the total loss value that 
accounts for the difference between real and synthetic forecasts as well as the mistake in predicting 
real data. This multi-modal method enables the simulation to give better risk-based evaluations 
and improve generalisation even in the presence of partial or restricted data. 
In essence, the CCNN model combines CNN and LSTM to extract and analyse characteristics 
from textual and numerical information. The GAN module improves data quality and modelling 
dependability, while the fluid integration of reinforced learning adjusts to modifications in 
marketplace conditions. By using the advantages of DL approaches, this all-inclusive system seeks 
to give a solid economic danger forecast option and a sophisticated and successful approach to risk 
managing. Hybrid Financial Risk Predictor (CCNN) is the suggested methodology. 
To handle the text and numeric information of finance states, we created a new algorithm called 
the Hybrid Financial Risk Prediction (CCNN), which combines CNN and LSTM. The connections 
in the information are modelled using a sophisticated construction framework in order to deal with 
the problems with risk prediction. 
A general structure known as CCNN is an economic construction models that can manage financial 
information and assess risk levels efficiently. Fig. 2 shows the model with an input layer, three 
compressed the layers, and an output layer. Because it minimises the volatility of the input 
information before it is fed into the system and gets the information ready for evaluation, 
preprocessing is crucial to the model. Dense layers are frequently arranged so that every layer 
transforms the input information in a series of ways that allow the system to infer intricate 
characteristics. During the training process, the model's characteristics are adjusted to get the 
lowest possible loss function. After that, the system is tested to comparison with a few signals. 
The outcomes provide insight into how well the suggested model performs in risk assessment and 
forecasting. Financial information grouping reveals hidden trends and groups of businesses with 
comparable risk characteristics. The goal of this method is to find homogenous groupings 
depending on their financial measurements, which can be very helpful for risk monitoring. It is not

a random process. Companies that belong to a high-risk group, for example, may show signs of 
possible trouble, such as low net income, excessive debt, and continual cash flow problems. 
Finance investigators can concentrate on particular groups that need more focus and specialised 
risk evaluation techniques by finding such clusters. Additionally, by modifying risk parameters 
according to each group's features, grouping enables the algorithm to improve the general precision 
and accessibility of the risk forecasts.

3.8 Procedure for training 
The model gets trained employing previous financial information. This includes both numerical 
values and language disclosures. The following are part of the instruction procedure: 
 Data splitting is the process of separating the collection of data into test, verification, and 
instructional sets. 
 Parameter optimisation: Improving model parameters employing methods such as descent 
with gradients. 
 Validity: To adjust hyperparameters and avoid excessive fitting, test the simulation on the 
set of validation data. 
This innovative method provides a strong foundation for predicting risk in finance by using the 
advantages of both CNN and LSTM. Combining numerical and verbal data guarantees thorough 
evaluation, which produces risk evaluations that are more precise and trustworthy. 
4. Results and Discussion 
The proposed deep learning framework for financial stress testing, integrating Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrated 
significant improvements in risk prediction accuracy and financial resilience. The model was 
trained and tested on historical financial data, incorporating both quantitative indicators (such as

revenue, net income, and earnings per share) and qualitative financial insights. The evaluation 
metrics, including training loss, testing loss, and risk reduction rates, were analyzed to assess the 
models performance. 
4.1 Model Performance and Loss Reduction 
The training and testing loss of the model progressively decreased, stabilizing at 0.0013 and 0.003, 
respectively. This indicates that the model effectively captured financial patterns and 
dependencies, minimizing prediction errors. The loss reduction trend signifies improved 
generalization, ensuring robust stress testing performance under different financial conditions. 
4.2 Financial Risk Mitigation 
A key objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the proposed model in mitigating 
financial risks. The results show a significant reduction across various risk categories: 
 Credit risk decreased from 0.75 to 0.20, indicating improved creditworthiness predictions 
and reduced exposure to loan defaults. 
 Liquidity risk declined from 0.70 to 0.25, enhancing the models ability to anticipate cash 
flow shortages and liquidity crises. 
 Market risk was reduced from 0.65 to 0.30, reflecting better adaptability to market 
fluctuations and external financial shocks. 
 Operational risk improved from 0.80 to 0.35, demonstrating enhanced detection of 
financial system vulnerabilities and internal inefficiencies. 
These results as in table 1 and figure 3 confirm that the deep learning framework provides a more 
reliable and accurate approach to financial stress testing than conventional models. 
4.3 Comparison with Traditional Models 
Compared to conventional risk assessment techniques, such as statistical regression models and 
expert-driven heuristic approaches, the deep learning-based framework demonstrated superior 
performance. The CNN-LSTM hybrid model was more effective in capturing nonlinear financial 
relationships and predicting risks under uncertain conditions. Traditional models exhibited higher 
error margins and limited adaptability to real-time financial fluctuations, while the deep learning 
framework consistently produced stable and accurate results. 
4.4 Implications for Financial Decision-Making 
The findings suggest that AI-driven stress testing enhances financial risk management by 
providing deeper insights into risk exposure and resilience as per the training in figure 4. The 
ability to process vast amounts of structured and unstructured financial data ensures that 
institutions can proactively identify vulnerabilities, comply with regulatory stress testing 
requirements, and strengthen financial stability. The proposed approach supports more informed 
decision-making for financial institutions, investors, and policymakers.

The proposed deep learning-based financial stress testing framework demonstrates significant 
improvements in risk assessment, predictive accuracy, and financial resilience. By integrating 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the 
model effectively captures both short-term and long-term dependencies in financial data. The 
results indicate substantial risk reduction across multiple categories, including credit, liquidity, 
market, and operational risks, showcasing the models robustness in handling financial 
uncertainties. The training and testing loss values stabilized at 0.0013 and 0.003, respectively, 
reflecting high prediction accuracy. Additionally, risk mitigation was evident, with credit risk 
dropping from 0.75 to 0.20, liquidity risk from 0.70 to 0.25, market risk from 0.65 to 0.30, and 
operational risk from 0.80 to 0.35. These findings validate the efficiency of deep learning in stress 
testing compared to conventional statistical models, which often struggle with nonlinear 
dependencies and real-time adaptability. Beyond technical advancements, the proposed 
framework offers significant implications for financial institutions, regulators, and policymakers. 
By providing a more accurate, data-driven approach to financial stress testing, it enables proactive 
risk mitigation, enhances regulatory compliance, and supports strategic decision-making. The 
ability to analyze vast amounts of financial data ensures timely identification of financial 
vulnerabilities, ultimately improving market stability. Future work could explore real-time stress 
testing applications, hybrid AI techniques combining ensemble learning, and macroeconomic 
forecasting integration. The proposed model establishes a foundation for AI-driven risk 
management, marking a significant step toward more resilient financial systems.
