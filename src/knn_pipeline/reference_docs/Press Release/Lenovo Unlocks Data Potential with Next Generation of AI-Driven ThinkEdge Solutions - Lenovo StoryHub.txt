Lenovo Unlocks Data Potential with Next Generation of AI-Driven ThinkEdge Solutions
New ThinkEdge devices deliver scalable, rugged, and versatile intelligence from gateway to high-performance edge for real-time insights.
23 February 2026
Lenovoâ"¢ expanded its ThinkEdge portfolio with a new generation of AI-driven edge computing solutions, including the compact and reliable ThinkEdge SE10n Gen 2, the AI-ready ThinkEdge SE30n Gen 2, the AI-powerhouse ThinkEdge SE60n Gen 2, and Lenovoâ€(tm)s first industrial all-in-one (AIO) Panel PC, the ThinkEdge SE50a.
As enterprises push intelligence closer to operations to improve resilience, reduce latency, and keep sensitive data local, edge computing has become a critical layer between devices, infrastructure, and cloud. Lenovoâ€(tm)s ThinkEdge solutions are purpose-built, industrial-grade edge systems designed to run reliably in harsh, space-constrained environments where traditional servers or PCs are impractical.
Powered by Intel Core processors with scalable AI options, the fanless rugged lineup features industrial design ideal for 24/7 operation in factories and warehouses, seamless connectivity with options for Wi-Fi 6E, cellular connectivity and more. Backed by Lenovoâ€(tm)s global supply chain, long lifecycle support, and enterprise-grade services, ThinkEdge solutions are engineered not just to deploy at scale, but to operate consistently over years of continuous use.
â€œEdge computing is where we turn insights into outcomes, and our next-generation ThinkEdge solutions place the power of AI exactly where decision making happens,â€ says Marc Godin, Vice President & General Manager, WW OEM Solutions â€" IDG Commercial. â€œPowering real-world AI applications delivering real-time data means loss prevention and instant inventory insights in retail; visual inspection and predictive maintenance in manufacturing; imaging workflow support and operation insights in healthcare; and even crowd management and infrastructure monitoring in cities and venues.â€
â€œOur latest ThinkEdge portfolio delivers a truly comprehensive suite of solutions designed with AI in mind, from intelligent gateways to high-performance edge computing systems,â€ states Sanjeev Menon, Vice President & General Manager, Desktop Computing Business. â€œAI at the edge must be intelligent, protected and manageable at scale, and our lineup delivers by combining the latest computing core components, critical manageability and protection capabilities, and vertical industry ruggedization to help customers turn insights into recommendations and action.â€
