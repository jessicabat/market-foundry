Afterpay and Cash App Bring Pay Over Time to where Visa(r) is Accepted
This upcoming pilot enables eligible U.S. Cash App Card holders to turn any eligible purchase at a merchant where Visa is accepted into a pay-in-6 loan, through the issuance of a new Cash App Visa(r) Debit Flex Card
The feature uses near real-time underwriting to serve a broad range of customers, including those who may have limited access to traditional credit options
DISTRIBUTED-WORK-MODEL/OAKLAND, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today Cash App announced the upcoming pilot launch of Afterpay on Cash App Card, a new feature that allows eligible Cash App Card holders to turn their upcoming online or in-store transaction into a pay-over-time purchase where Visa is accepted, through the issuance of a new Visa Debit Flex Card.
This launch will unite Cash App Card features like no hidden fees, fraud protection, and custom weekly offers with a new pay-over-time option through one new intuitive card. Eligible customers can order a Visa Debit Flex Card that includes all the standard Cash App Card features, plus the ability to turn on Afterpay in-app to pay-over-time for a purchase where Visa is accepted. The pilot will launch in the coming months, with plans for a larger rollout in early 2026.
"We're bringing together Block's underwriting muscle with Afterpay's proven pay-over-time expertise to deliver something our 26 million monthly Cash App Card actives have been asking for," said Owen Jennings, Executive Officer and Head of Business at Block, Inc. "We're offering a transparent form of credit and a real alternative for Americans who want flexibility without the traditional baggage often associated with credit cards. Consumer credit is shifting, and we're built to lead that shift."
Afterpay on Cash App Card addresses essential customer needs by providing an alternate solution for managing expenses and cash flow. Using Cash App's advanced near real-time data analysis, the product serves a broad range of customers, including those who may have limited access to traditional credit options or choose to avoid revolving credit. Instead of looking backward at credit scores, the platform evaluates current financial behaviors such as cash flow patterns, spending habits, savings, and payment consistency to determine eligibility.
Designed for transparency, the 6-week loan structure includes a clear finance fee and manageable repayment options** - six equal weekly payments or full balance payment at any time. Initial amounts up to a few hundred dollars can increase based on payment performance, eliminating traditional credit complexity. The product includes built-in safeguards and customer protections. For example, if a final payment is missed, a customer is unable to open another Afterpay on Cash App Card purchase or originate new loans through Cash App and Afterpay, ensuring responsible credit management across our ecosystem.
Cash App is the money app. Banking* on Cash App is easy: customers can receive paychecks early with direct deposit, spend money where Visa is accepted with a personalized Cash App Card, and grow their money with a separate savings balance - all without hidden fees. Customers can also create a unique $Cashtag to share with anyone to get paid fast, make purchases with Cash App Pay, trade stocks and buy and sell bitcoin***, and pay over time with Cash App Afterpay. Download Cash App for free at cash.app/download.
