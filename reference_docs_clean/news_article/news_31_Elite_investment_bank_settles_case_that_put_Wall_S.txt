Elite investment bank settles case that put Wall Street's 100-hour weeks on trial

Centerview Partners and former junior banker Kathryn Shiber have reached a settlement, ending a closely watched lawsuit about Wall Street work culture that was set to go to trial in Manhattan federal court.

The case centered on allegations that the boutique investment bank violated disability discrimination laws when it fired Shiber in 2020 after she said she needed eight to nine hours of sleep each night because of an underlying mood and anxiety disorder.

Court filings and depositions in the case offered a rare look into the grueling demands placed on first-year analysts, including testimony that they typically work between 60 and 120 hours a week and that "in some projects, you are working 24 hours a day."

Centerview has denied wrongdoing.

"Centerview has said all along that Ms. Shiber's legal claims have no merit," a Centerview spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement. "We were ready to prove that in court, and are confident we would have prevailed at trial. But we are nonetheless happy to put this distraction behind us and focus on delivering for our clients."

The resolution means a jury will not weigh in on questions about Wall Street's long hours and workplace accommodations.

Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. Lawyers for Shiber did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.
