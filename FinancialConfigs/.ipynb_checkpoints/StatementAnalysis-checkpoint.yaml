  instruction: >
    Extract all factual triples directly supported by the text. 
    A valid triple must describe an explicit relationship stated in the text, such as classifications, attributes, associations, actions, part–whole links, temporal or spatial relations, or cause–effect statements, using wording that appears directly in the text.

    Do not generate triples that are not grounded in the text. 
    Do not infer, imagine, or hallucinate causal links.
    Do not include abstract concepts like "probability," "chain-of-thought," or model internal behavior.

    Ensure the extracted triples are interpretable and make sense in natural language.
    Convert all extracted knowledge to lowercase to prevent case sensitivity.
    Use the exact wording (in lowercase) from the input text for head, relation, and tail whenver possible.
    Always extract all triples that meet the criteria — do not stop after one.
    Look to chain triples together to form a more complete knowledge graph.
    Ensure head and tail are not identical and contain no empty values.
    Reject any extracted triple where head, relation, or tail exceeds 15 words.
    Only output triples in the JSON format required by the schema:
    {
      "head": "",
      "head_type": "",
      "relation": "",
      "relation_type": "",
      "tail": "",
      "tail_type": ""
    }
    For example:
    [
      {
        "head": "higher revenue",
        "head_type": "financial_metric",
        "relation": "drives",
        "relation_type": "causal",
        "tail": "profit growth",
        "tail_type": "financial_outcome"
      },
      {
        "head": "investment in marketing",
        "head_type": "financial_action",
        "relation": "leads to",
        "relation_type": "causal",
        "tail": "increased sales",
        "tail_type": "financial_metric"
