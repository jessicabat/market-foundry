  instruction: >
    Extract all factual triples directly supported by the text. 
    A valid triple must describe an explicit relationship stated in the text, such as classifications, attributes, associations, actions, part–whole links, temporal or spatial relations, or cause–effect statements, using wording that appears directly in the text.

    Do not generate triples that are not grounded in the text. 
    Do not infer, imagine, or hallucinate causal links.
    Do not include abstract concepts like "probability," "chain-of-thought," or model internal behavior.

    Ensure the extracted triples are interpretable and make sense in natural language.
    Convert all extracted knowledge to lowercase to prevent case sensitivity.
    Use the exact wording (in lowercase) from the input text for head, relation, and tail whenver possible.
    Always extract all triples that meet the criteria — do not stop after one.
    Look to chain triples together to form a more complete knowledge graph.
    Ensure head and tail are not identical and contain no empty values.
    Reject any extracted triple where head, relation, or tail exceeds 15 words.

    The input is an earnings call transcript. Use its structure to guide extraction:
    - Treat named speakers and their roles as entities:
    • Executives (e.g., "alex chriss", "chief financial officer") → Person / Executive
    • Analysts (e.g., "timothy edward chiodo") → Person
    • The main company on the call → Company
    You may extract triples like:(executive, leads, company), (executive, holds_role, role_title).
    
    - Prioritize triples that capture:
    • Reported results for a specific period
      (e.g., "q3 2025 revenue grew 10% to $4.2 billion").
    • Guidance or outlook 
      (e.g., "company guides q4 2025 revenue to $4.4–4.5 billion").
    • Segment performance 
      (e.g., "consumer segment revenue declined 5% year over year").
    • Explicitly stated drivers and headwinds
      (e.g., "growth was driven by ai demand", "margin pressure was due to higher costs").
    • Capital allocation actions
      (e.g., share repurchases, dividends, acquisitions, restructurings).

    - Use the transcript structure:
    • "Prepared remarks" sections often contain headline metrics and strategy.
    • "Q&A" sections often clarify metrics, strategy, and risks.
      Extract triples from Q&A only when a question or answer states a factual
      relationship (for example, a clear explanation of what is driving a metric
      or how a product affects results).
    • Ignore operator instructions such as "our next question comes from..." or
      "please stand by" unless they contain a meaningful financial fact.

    - Forward-looking statements:
    • If guidance is explicitly quantified or clearly described, you may extract
      it as a factual triple about guidance (e.g., "company, guides, q4 2025 revenue").
    • Generic legal disclaimers and boilerplate forward-looking statement text
      should be ignored unless they mention a specific risk or event
      that can be clearly turned into a factual triple.

    - Periods and comparison:
    • Whenever possible, include the relevant time period in the metric or as a
      separate Period entity (e.g., "q3 2025", "full year 2024").
    • Capture explicit comparisons such as year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter
      changes when they are clearly stated (e.g., "revenue increased 12% year over year").
